#' @title Density based algorithm (ISDBSCAN) for large single cell sequencing data
#'
#' @description This is an implementation of the ISDBSCAN algorithm of
#'   Cassisi et al (2013) adapted to manage large single cell sequencing data.
#'
#' @details The contribution of this package is to provide support for on-disk
#'   data representations such as HDF5, through the use of \code{DelayedMatrix}
#'   and \code{HDF5Matrix} objects, as well as for sparse data representation
#'   through the classes of the \code{Matrix} package.

#'@param k the number of neighbours
#'@param batch_size the size of the readed chunk
#'@param stratif either TRUE or FALSE, TRUE if we want to stratifie the data, FALSE otherwise.
